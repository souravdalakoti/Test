                            Choosing a good Consultant can mean improved likelihood at Admissions to my dream Schools, as also Scholarships.

                            “The Ivy League Edge” is founded and headed by Bala, who studied in FT programs at XLRI, JNU & Yale, each a dream school in its category. He understands the dreams and diverse needs of various types of candidates. No wonder his clients recommend him PUBLICLY on LinkedIn (all such clients can be connected with personally) to help you understand why “The Ivy League Edge” can give wings to your dreams too.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The huge scholarships our candidates have received have given them upto 64X their investments in a good consultant. Of course, admissions to their dream schools have changed the course of their lives. Even 6-7 years later, clients have reached out to express their gratitude on how their learnings during the application process have continued to help them professionally.

                            “The Ivy League Edge” believes that Publicly Verifiable Recommendations are REAL. Testimonials however, can often be self-generated by Consultants.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is because, Testimonials are <strong>presented by Consultants,</strong> often on private websites controlled by them. Recommendations, however, are earned on Social Media Platforms (like LinkedIn), are <strong>Publicly Verifiable,</strong> and are in <strong>Client’s own words</strong>.

                            If you lose a year due to your consultant, not only would you have wasted time and money, but also you may become LESS attractive to your dream school because of your higher age if you apply next year. “The Ivy League Edge” believes that these Consultants are the Costliest, regardless of how much money they charged.

                            Each candidate may have a different story, and may need to showcase achievements in a different light. Brainstorming for ideas, refining them, and editing individual documents are therefore, best done separately for each. Friends/ groups of applicants however, applying together for the same program can benefit from joining the “Low Cost, High Touch Group Sessions”. For maximum effectiveness, such batches will be of 4-6 candidates.

Any refunds will incur a 10% deduction.
